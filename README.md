# CovidDetect

We are suffering from severe global covid-19 pandemic health crisis. More tough part of this health crisis is that till now we donâ€™t have vaccine and available covid-19 testing technique RT-PCR has limited sensitivity and also takes long time in result. RT-PCR kit is also not easily available in mass quantity. As covid-19 is respiratory disease,  we can detect it from Chest X-Ray. X-Ray machine are easily available in hospital. Also, it is cheap alternative option for RT-PCR and gives result in few minutes of time.
